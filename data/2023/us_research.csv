Duke,Data Science for Operations and Planning at Durham Public Schools,https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/data-science-for-operations-and-planning-at-durham-public-schools/,"A team of students will analyze, map, and visualize student enrollment and demographic data in Durham County. The team will collaborate closely with analytics professionals at the Durham Public Schools (DPS) operations department and will provide analysis to help DPS plan and manage student enrollment and improve fairness in its student assignment policies.",Data+
Duke,Strengthening Partnerships: Durham Schools & Local Universities*,https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/strengthening-partnerships-durham-schools-local-universities/,"Using data from the Durham Compass and the NC School Report Card among many other sources, this team will continue the development of an interactive R Shiny dashboard that permits exploration of school statistical data. The team aims to explore Durham Public School (DPS) zones through an asset-based lens to support ethical and imaginative partnerships between Duke, North Carolina Central, and Durham Public Schools. The dashboard will act as reference for university students, families, and teachers. This is a continuation of a joint Duke-NCCU Bass Connections project.",Data+
Duke,Assessing and Improving Girls' and Women's Math Identity,https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/assessing-and-improving-girls-and-womens-math-identity-2023-2024,"Building on the work of previous teams, this project team will work to improve girls’ and women’s math identity by both directly addressing STEM-relevant skills in free math workshops for middle school girls in Durham and incorporating “preparation for bias” research and training into workshop planning and implementation. Preparation for bias is the process of building awareness of discrimination and bias as well as building skills and techniques to cope with future discrimination",Bass Connections
Duke,Enhancing Diversity in STEM Careers Through Mentored Training,https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/enhancing-diversity-stem-careers-through-mentored-training-2023-2024,"The overall goal of this project is to enhance STEM career readiness for high school, specifically students from groups who have been systematically prevented from pursuing STEM careers. To accomplish this goal, the team will implement and evaluate a comprehensive year-long curriculum focused on the intersection of environmental science and health, which includes college- and career-readiness training and mentorship. Team members will serve as mentors for the Health and Environmental Scholars Program @Duke (HESP), meeting with Durham Public School (DPS) high school students during weekly in-person sessions throughout the school year.",Bass Connections
Duke,Ignite: Improving Students' STEM-Identity Through Human-Centered Design,https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/ignite-improving-students-stem-identity-through-human-centered-design-2023-2024,This project team will develop a research framework for engineering education to govern future Ignite implementations in Durham and inform the larger engineering education field.,Bass Connections
Duke,Increasing Children's Sense of Belonging in STEM Fields,https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/increasing-childrens-sense-belonging-stem-fields-2023-2024,This project team will work with the Museum of Life and Science in Durham to design and implement a pilot study centered on creating a structured and encouraging experience for young children visiting the museum. The museum has a proud history of serving the community by providing engaging STEM learning experiences and extracurricular programming. Its ongoing partnership with Duke is guided by a mission to cultivate relationships between scientists and the broader community and serve as a “living lab” for research with children and families at the museum.,Bass Connections
Duke,Strengthening Partnerships Between Durham Schools and Local Universities,https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/strengthening-partnerships-between-durham-schools-and-local-universities-2023-2024,"Building on the work of previous teams, the 2023-2024 team will develop, refine and share training modules to prepare undergraduate students for equitable partnerships with local schools as well as data visualization resources to support university students and community stakeholders in learning more about Durham communities. Team members will also investigate ways community schools can provide health services to community members.",Bass Connections
