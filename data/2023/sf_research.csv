Duke,Diversifying the STEM Workforce by Promoting Positive College and Career Outcomes Among Local High School Students From Systemically Excluded Identities,https://scholars.duke.edu/person/meagan.dunphy-daly,"Individuals from backgrounds historically excluded from STEM represent less than one in five STEM college graduates. The objective of this project is to evaluate the impact of multiple years of a near-peer mentored, year-long program on 1) promoting positive science identity among Durham Public Schools high school students from historically excluded identities, and 2) increasing college application success for these students by enhancing student readiness for undergraduate STEM majors through experiential education and college application workshops. The ultimate goal is to increase diversity across STEM fields and support future leaders in STEM.",STEM
Duke,Gesture: A Cultural Intervention for Learning Outcomes,https://scholars.duke.edu/person/sarah.gaither,"One potential cost-effective avenue to improve learning could be using a culturally-based intervention such as gesturing, where teachers regardless of race are encouraged to gesture while instructing. Based on pilot data, teachers using gestures increased memory for new words by 16% across all racial groups. This was measured through children watching a series of videos of “teachers” playing with novel gadgets and teaching “fun facts” about each object. This project will translate this intervention from an online to an in-person platform through community partnerships with Durham and Johnston County schools.",Psychology
Duke,"Hello, Ethi{CS}: Codesigning Ethics-Centered Computational Education to Broaden Participation in College and Career Readiness",https://scholars.duke.edu/person/aria.chernik,"Open design is an equity-centered innovation methodology. This community-engaged research project seeks to understand how the implementation of an open design innovation framework impacts attitudinal shifts among educators toward creating equitable educational change and toward teaching ethics-centered computing. In addition, the project will explore how using an ethics-centered, project-based approach to computing education impacts attitudinal shifts among Black, female-identifying and lower-income students toward the social justice implications of technology and toward computing education and careers.",Education
Duke,Inspiring the Next Generation of STEM Learners,https://scholars.duke.edu/person/shani.b,"This project aims to enhance the college and career readiness of middle and high school students, promote persistence in STEM majors for undergraduate students and examine the effectiveness of this approach in retaining women and minoritized students in STEM fields. Collaborating with Inspiring Minds, a nonprofit organization in Durham, researchers will implement and evaluate an intervention using quantitative and qualitative measures. The findings from this research will offer valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners to design effective strategies that promote diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM education and career paths.",STEM
Duke,"Racial Inequity in Early Grade School Suspensions: Building Community Partnership and Evidence to Bridge Advocacy, Law and Policy",https://scholars.duke.edu/person/sarah.komisarow,"This project will pursue several objectives related to rates of school suspension as well as racial gaps in suspensions among students enrolled in kindergarten through second grades. The children, parents and communities most impacted by early grade suspensions are often left out of the conversation. Building on existing community partnerships with local education justice advocates will ensure equitable, substantive collaboration with community partners throughout every phase of the research process.",Education
Duke,Teaching for Hope During Climate Uncertainty: Working With Teachers to Coproduce Climate Resilience Curriculum for Middle Schoolers and Their Communities,https://scholars.duke.edu/person/lisa.m.campbell,"Researchers at Duke and NC State are supporting Carteret County teachers to create and implement a locally relevant resiliency curriculum that blends personal, ecological and social resilience through classroom and community-based activities. Preliminary results from an assessment are encouraging among teachers, students, and community members. This project will expand the research into Durham to explore if and how the process of curriculum cocreation and the topic of resilience are applicable in both rural and urban systems, and if they can be scaled throughout North Carolina and beyond.",Climate
Duke,Durham University-Assisted Community Schools Research Collective,https://scholars.duke.edu/person/alec.greenwald,"Durham University-Assisted Community Schools Research Collective is a grassroots effort to support Durham Public Schools in addressing the challenges surrounding equitable school experiences and outcomes. The group envisions community schools as bringing together academics, health and social services, youth development and community engagement under one roof. Duke and North Carolina Central— two local universities— are central to this endeavor as part of the university-assisted community schools model.",Education
Duke,University-Assisted Community Schools: Cultivating Educator Voice and Agency for Equity,https://scholars.duke.edu/person/kstephen,"Community schools are comprehensive neighborhood centers that educate, engage and serve all members of the community through democratic participation, community-driven problem-solving and reciprocal partnership. This project will pilot a University-Assisted Community Schools model with Durham Public Schools, focusing on empowering educators to provide equitable educational experiences for children and youth. Another targeted outcome is the creation of a community school coordinator workforce pipeline that will further ensure Durham Public Schools is equipped with the human capital necessary to sustain and grow the model.",Education
NCCU,Educare Learning Network Addressing Racial Disparities: Focus on Black-Majority Educare Schools,https://www.nccu.edu/employee/nsmith42,"Through this planning grant, the researchers will leverage the Educare Learning Network as a platform for change to critically examine, innovate, and systematically evaluate ways to amplify and address racial equities and disparities in the early years, resulting in lifelong resolutions.",Education
