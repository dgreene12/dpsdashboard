Local produce is typically minimally processed, and grown without the use of pesticides, antibiotics, and genetic modification. Due to the short travel to nearby markets and cheaper cost of produce, farmers’ markets can be a more affordable option for local residents.'

Although some families are able to rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as “food stamps,” there are some families that earn too much to receive SNAP; but, don’t make enough money to afford adequate meals. Older adults and people with disabilities that are on fixed incomes sometimes have to choose between paying for medicine or purchasing nutritious food. Food pantries can provide individuals and families with supplemental food allowing them to reallocate money they would have used on food for rent or other utilities.'

The areas lacking sufficient healthy food are often called “food deserts.” Food insecurity should not be considered a natural, geographical issue; but, rather an intentional denial of resources for historically marginalized racial groups. Thus, the term “food apartheid” has gained traction in recent years, and is now often preferred. We hope to show areas affected by food apartheid in an attempt to raise awareness about food insecurity.'
